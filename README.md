# ADO Improvement Proposals

ADO projects need a way how to document their technical decisions and features.
For some of them, the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) are not the right place because their range and implications are outside of the scope of Ethereum.

The ADOIPs repository is an extension to the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIPs) process and contains the documents that are unsuitable for submission to the EIPs repository.

Each ADOIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.
